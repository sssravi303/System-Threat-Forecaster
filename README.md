System Threat Forecaster where I had to classify whether a system is vulnerable to a kind of threat or attack using the 1 lakh data samples with 75 features which had both categorical and Numerical columns. I have performed data preprocessing and I have used popular classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, NaiveBayes Classifiers,  LightBGM and tuning them with hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
